# Nova HeroIcon UI

This tool allows you to use all icons on [heroicons-ui](https://github.com/sschoger/heroicons-ui) on Laravel Nova
on your custom tool, resource-tool, custom index/detail tool bars - which was actually what started me on this package.

This package makes usage of the awesome [heroicons-ui](https://github.com/sschoger/heroicons-ui) from Steve Schoger. 

## Installation

You can install the package in to a Laravel app that uses [Nova](https://nova.laravel.com) via composer:

```bash
composer require rmsj/nova-hero-icon
```
